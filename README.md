# DevOps & SRE Portfolio – Gabriel Gonzalez Montero

This repository collects examples of how I approach multi-cloud DevOps, SRE practices, and AI-driven automation.  
Each folder is based on real scenarios I’ve worked on or prepared for, simplified for demo purposes but documented the way I would explain them to a teammate.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description | AI Integration | Notes |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| infra-as-code-aws/ | Terraform module creating an S3 bucket | No | In production I’d add versioning, lifecycle rules, and remove force_destroy. |
| ci-cd-pipeline-demo/ | Python app with GitHub Actions pipeline | No | Real pipelines include staging/prod jobs, approvals, and caching. |
| k8s-observability-stack/ | Prometheus + Grafana manifests for Kubernetes | No | In production I’d deploy via Helm, with HA and persistent volumes. |
| aiops-log-analyzer/ | Python script to detect error spikes in logs | Optional | Can be extended with LLMs to generate summaries of anomalies. |
| aws-bedrock-incident-summarizer/ | CloudWatch Alarm → Lambda → Bedrock summary | Yes | Would connect to Slack/Teams, enforce IAM least privilege. |
| gcp-vertex-release-notes/ | Cloud Run service: commit metadata → release notes | Yes | Add authentication (IAP), service account scoping, and storage. |
| azure-openai-incident-helper/ | Azure OpenAI tool to generate KQL + checklists | Yes | Would wrap as a Function App, secure with KeyVault and RBAC. |
| oci-genai-cost-triage/ | Parses OCI cost exports and suggests actions | Yes | Plug into Budgets/Notifications, integrate with weekly FinOps. |

## Why this repo exists

- To demonstrate experience across AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI.  
- To document patterns that I actually use in real projects, with notes on what I’d change in production.  
- To explore how AI can reduce operational toil: summarizing incidents, generating queries, and helping with cost triage.  
- To provide practical, annotated code that’s easier to learn from than “perfect” but abstract examples.
