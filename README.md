# Gabo's DevOps/SRE Portfolio

This repo collects small, realistic demos I use to discuss how I work:
- infra-as-code-aws: Terraform baseline (notes on prod vs lab)
- ansible-server-automation: quick webserver role
- k8s-observability-stack: Prometheus + Grafana (what I'd change for prod)
- ci-cd-pipeline-demo: tests + container build + smoke check
- aiops-log-analyzer: simple spike detector for noisy logs

Notes:
- I try to leave human comments explaining trade-offs and what I'd do in production.
- No real secrets here (obviously). Use sample values only.
