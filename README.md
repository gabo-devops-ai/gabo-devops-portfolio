This repository collects examples of how I approach multi-cloud DevOps, SRE practices, and AI-driven automation. Each folder is based on real scenarios I‚Äôve worked on or prepared for, simplified for demo purposes but documented the way I would explain them to a teammate.

## üéØ Why this repo exists

- To demonstrate experience across AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI.  
- To document patterns that I actually use in real projects, with notes on what I‚Äôd change in production.  
- To explore how AI can reduce operational toil: summarizing incidents, generating queries, and helping with cost triage.  
- To provide practical, annotated code that‚Äôs easier to learn from than ‚Äúperfect‚Äù but abstract examples.
